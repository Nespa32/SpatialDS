To build the executable:
$ cd repo
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make

This generates an executable named "runnable", in the build directory.
It has the following options:
Option              Meaning
 --seed <n>         Sets initial rng seed, 42 by default
 --box_size <n>     Sets bounding box size for spatial data structure construction, default is 1e9
 --batch_size <n>   Number of points in a batch during measurements, default is 1e6
 --loops <n>        Number of loops, each uses a single batch (each batch increases data structure size, no wipe). 10 by default
Follow options enable/disable method measurements, and are enabled by default
0 disables the operation, >0 enables it
 --find <b>         "Find"
 --insert <b>       "Insert"
 --delete <b>       "Delete"
 --nn <b>           "Nearest Neighbour"
 --knn <b>          "K-Nearest Neighbour"
 --rangesearch <b>  "Range Search"

Output of the program are the measurements on all 3 data structures (Point-region quadtrees, Point quadtrees, Kd-trees) for the selected methods

Examples:
Measure inserts with each batch having 50000 points
$ ./runnable --batch_size 50000 --loops 10 --insert 1 --find 0 --delete 0 --nn 0 --knn 0 --rangesearch 0
Measure everything with default options
$ ./runnable
